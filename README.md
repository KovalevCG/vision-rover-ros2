# ROS2 Vision Rover (In Progress)

### Technologies
- ROS2
- Python
- C++
- OpenCV
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi

---

This is a **work-in-progress** project aimed at developing a four-wheel robot for environment mapping and vision-based tasks. The robot integrates:

- **LiDAR** for environment mapping
- **Camera** for vision processing
- **Remote control** capabilities

Currently, this repository contains **early-stage** resources, including a photo of the robot and some initial code.

### Upcoming Features
- Full integration of ROS2 with LiDAR and camera modules
- Remote control functionality
- Detailed project documentation

## Project Stages:
### Stage 2: Robot Movement Test (Completed)
- The robot successfully moves, controlled by an Arduino.
### Stage 1: Robot Assembly (Completed)
#### The current assembly includes a four-wheel chassis with the following components:
- The motors are connected to the Arduino via the L298N motor driver module
- LiDAR module for mapping the environment
- Camera module for real-time vision processing
- Raspberry Pi to run ROS2 and manage communication between the modules
- Power system: The robot uses a rechargeable battery pack to power all electronics.
- Wiring & Electronics: Wires are routed neatly, ensuring safe connections between the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, motor drivers, and sensors.
- Mounting: All components are securely mounted on the robot chassis, leaving space for future upgrades.
